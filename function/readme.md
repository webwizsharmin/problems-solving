# FUNCTION

This project is problem solving challenge for Function basic to advance problem. Here I have completed many types of problem. Some description is given in below

## LEVEL-1: Warm-Up (Basic Understanding)

1. Write a function that takes a number and returns whether it’s even or odd.

2. Write a function that takes a strings and returns it reversed.

3. Write a function that returns the largest of three numbers.

## LEVEL-2: Logic Challenges

1. Create a function that takes an array and returns a new array with only the unique values.

2. Write a function that counts how many times each character appears in a string. (Return an object - e.g. {a:2, b:1})

## LEVEL-3: Function Mastery

1. Build a function factory:
   A function makeMultipler(n) that returns a new function which multiplies anything by n.

2. Write a function using default parameters that calculates total price with optional tax rate.

3. Write a function that accepts another function as parameter and runs it 5 times.

## LEVEL-4: Higher Level(Closures & Callbacks)

1. Create a counter function using closure. It should increase count each time you call it.

2. Write a function once(fn) that: runs the given function only once returns the result every next call returns the first result

## LEVEL-5: Real Interview Level

1. Implement a function that: takes an array of numbers returns a function that when called, returns the next number in sequence and when sequence ends, returns "done"

2. Write your own version of Array.prototype.map() as a function
